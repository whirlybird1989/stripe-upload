# Stripe Sandbox Bulk Import Script

## How to Use

1. Replace the price IDs in `main.py` inside `PRODUCT_PRICES` with your actual Stripe test price IDs.
2. Upload your real `CLIENT.csv` to the same directory.
3. Run `main.py` in Replit or your Python environment.

Make sure to set your Stripe test secret key correctly.
